#DAY 1:
- Write a function called add_checker that accepts two arguments.
- The first argument is a list containing at least two integers. 
- The second argument is an integer.
- The add_checker function should return True if there are two integers in the list of integers (first argument) that when added together, equals the integer passed in as the second argument.
- If there are no two integers in the list that sum up to equal the second argument, add_checker should return false.
